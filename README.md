### US Bikshare Data Analysis

### Description
For this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 was provided for the three cities, which contained the following 6 columns:
	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
	Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also had the following two columns:
	Gender
	Birth Year
	

### Files used
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

Note: Files were provided by Udacity.
