### US Bikshare Data Analysis

### Description
For this project, pandas library is heavily used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington - for the first six months of 2017.

An interactive user experience is created as the user is first prompted to provide inputs for the city, month, and day for which he/she would like to see the data. Based on the user inputs, the relevant data are used to perform the following statistical calculations:
- Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
1) most common month
2) most common day of week
3) most common hour of day
- Popular stations and trip
1) most common start station
2) most common end station
3) most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
- Trip duration
1) total travel time
2) average travel time
- User info
1) counts of each user type
2) counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
3) earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
